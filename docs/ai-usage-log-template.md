# AI Usage Log Template

Document how you collaborated with AI tools throughout the assignment. Copy this file to something like `docs/ai-usage-log.md` in your working branch and fill it in as you go.

## How To Use This Log
- Add a new entry each time you consult an AI assistant (Cursor, ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, etc.).
- Summaries should explain what you asked, what you received, and how you applied or rejected the suggestion.
- Feel free to paste snippets or links to relevant commits.

### Entry Template

- **Date & Time:**  
- **Tool(s) Used:**  
- **Prompt / Question:**  
- **Summary of AI Response:**  
- **How You Used It:** (implemented as-is, modified, discarded; explain why)  
- **Related Commit / File (optional):**

Repeat the template for each meaningful interaction. The goal is to showcase how you validate, adapt, and iterate on AI-generated ideas—not to capture trivial grammar fixes.
