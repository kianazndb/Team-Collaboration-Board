# 🧩 Intern Pre-Interview Task: Team Collaboration Board

## 🎯 Goal
Build a lightweight **Team Collaboration Board** (similar to Trello) where multiple users can organize and manage tasks in real time.  
This project tests your ability to build a full-stack app using **modern tools and AI-assisted development** (e.g., Cursor, ChatGPT, Copilot).

---

## 🕒 Duration
**2–3 days**

You can use AI tools to accelerate development — we want to see how effectively you can combine tools, frameworks, and design to deliver a clean, functional app.

---

## ✅ Before You Start
- Make a personal fork or copy of this repository.
- Read `README.md` to understand expectations and submission steps.
- Copy `docs/ai-usage-log-template.md` to `docs/ai-usage-log.md` (or similar) and keep it updated while you work.
- Review `docs/submission-checklist.md` to know what we expect at handoff time.

## 🧱 Core Requirements

### 1. Features
- 🪶 **Boards:** Users can create multiple boards (e.g., “Design”, “Development”).
- 🗂️ **Tasks:** Each board has tasks with title, description, and status (“To Do”, “Doing”, “Done”).
- 🔁 **Drag & Drop:** Tasks can be moved between columns.
- 👥 **Collaboration:** Changes update across users (simulate realtime if needed).
- 💾 **Persistence:** Store tasks and boards in a database (Supabase, Firebase, etc.).

---

### 2. Bonus Features *(optional but impressive)*
- 🔐 User authentication (Clerk, Auth.js, or Supabase Auth)
- 💬 Comments on tasks
- ⚡ Real-time sync (Supabase Realtime, Firebase, or mock WebSocket)
- 🌗 Light/Dark theme toggle
- 🤖 AI “Task Suggestion” (e.g., use ChatGPT API to propose next steps)
