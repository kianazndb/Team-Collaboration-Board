# Team Collaboration Board – Intern Challenge

Welcome! This repository contains the take-home assignment we send to candidates for the Team Collaboration Board internship. The challenge is designed to evaluate how effectively you can leverage modern web tooling and AI-assisted development to deliver a polished, end-to-end product.

## Read This First
- Review `task_description.md` for the full product brief.
- Skim `docs/submission-checklist.md` before you start; keep it close to ensure you cover all requirements.
- Log your use of AI-assistance in `docs/ai-usage-log-template.md` (copy it to a new file in your branch so reviewers can see your notes).

## Expectations
- Build a functional, pleasant Team Collaboration Board app in roughly 2–3 days of focused effort.
- Combine your own problem solving with AI tooling (Cursor, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) and document how it helped.
- Make thoughtful technology choices; explain them in your README when you submit.
- Keep commits clean and incremental to illustrate your workflow.

## Deliverables You Owe Us
- Source code in a public GitHub repo (or a private repo shared back with us).
- Updated project README that covers architecture, tooling, AI usage, challenges, and setup instructions.
- AI usage log (see the template in `docs/`).
- Screenshots or a short loom/video demo to highlight the user experience.
- Optional but appreciated: a live deployment (Vercel, Netlify, Supabase, etc.).

## How To Submit
1. Fork or duplicate this repository into your own GitHub account.
2. Implement your solution in your copy; keep main free of broken code.
3. Ensure the submission checklist is satisfied and the AI usage log is filled in.
4. Share the repository link (and deployment, if any) with us before your interview.

## Evaluation Snapshot
We assess your submission across UI polish, code quality, architecture, AI-assisted workflow, and communication. The detailed rubric lives in `task_description.md`.

Questions or blockers? Note them in your README when you submit. We want insight into how you reason through challenges as much as the final product itself.
